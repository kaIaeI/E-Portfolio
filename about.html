    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Kalael Gileon Magnus Ortiz Dabao</strong>, and I am a student in the Computer Systems Technology (CST) program at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I am building foundational skills in computer hardware, networking, programming, and web development while exploring different areas of IT.</p>

    <p>I chose CST because I’ve always been interested in understanding how technology works—from computers and networks to software and systems. I enjoy hands-on problem solving, learning new tools, and building projects that help me grow my technical skills.</p>

    <p>My goals are to continue strengthening my programming abilities, improve my troubleshooting skills, and develop a strong understanding of system administration. This portfolio highlights the projects I’ve completed and the progress I’m making as I work toward a future career in the IT field.</p>
