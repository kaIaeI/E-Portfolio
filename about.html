  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is <strong>Kalael Gileon Magnus Ortiz Dabao</strong>, and I am a student in the Computer Systems Technology (CST) program at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I am currently developing my foundational skills in computer hardware, networking, programming, and web development. I enjoy learning how computer systems work behind the scenes and exploring different areas of technology as I progress through the program.</p>

  <p>I chose the CST program because I’ve always been curious about how computers operate, how networks communicate, and how software is created. I like problem-solving, taking on hands-on projects, and figuring out how to fix technical issues. Every semester has introduced me to new skills, and I am motivated to keep learning and growing as I move toward a future career in the IT field.</p>

  <p>My academic and project experience so far has introduced me to key areas such as troubleshooting, system fundamentals, and basic web technologies. As I continue my studies, my goals are to strengthen my programming abilities, deepen my understanding of system administration, and build projects that demonstrate what I can do.</p>

  <p>This e-portfolio highlights my learning journey, the projects I’ve completed, and the skills I am developing. I look forward to expanding my technical knowledge and gaining real-world experience that will help me become a confident and capable IT professional.</p>
